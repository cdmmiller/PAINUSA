		<h3>Study001: Bloodhawks</h3>
		<p>We have all heard of blackwoods, but not many people study them. I am determined to be the person who does. Starting with bloodhawks, since I can't think of a way it would kill me. <br><br> Bloodhawks are parasitic, bacterial blackwoods that latch onto things, and somehow, someway, make them poisonous to eat. I'm not sure how, but I am determined to find out. I will give daily and hourly updates, and will give unscheduled updates if something happens. I will start tomorrow, 6:00 AM.<br><br>06:00.<br>Im out on the field, on the look for animals infected by bloodhawks. The idea is that I will feed an animal I suspect is safe to a deathrow inmate, and one that I suspect has undergone the infection procedure of a bloodhawk. <br><br>7:00.<br>I found many animals that I thought could have been poisoned, and yet, none were. I am starting to lose hope about this whole experiment, considering I haven't found anything yet.<br><br>Important.<br>I finally found one that was poisoned, fed it to an inmate on death row, and instant death occured. According to the warden, and his medical history, he had no recorded immune system weakening illnesses or ailments. So let it be known, bloodhawk poison is extremely fatal.<br><br>8:00<br>I fed some more poisonous pigs, and some more safe pigs, and near instant death almost always occured. However, I also studied the behavior of a safe and a poisonous pig, 5 of each. They always act the exact same. I have gotten extremely lucky with time, and so, I can now move onto plants that have been infected by bloodhawks.<br><br>Important.<br>I fed the first poisoned and the first safe plant only 15 minutes after starting! I am having extreme luck with these bloodhawks. Unfortunately, however, no visible differences were found between a safe plant and a bloodhawk-poison induced plant. The inmate died instantly after eating the food, just like always. <br><br>9:00.<br>I think I jinxed it. I haven't gotten another bloodhawk since then.

I fed them ███, in case it was of any importance.
